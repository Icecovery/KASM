# KASM

KASM is a mod for Kerbal Space Program. 

Currently still working in progress.

## What does this mod do?

KASM aims to add a series of sensors and actuators (brand new parts and existing stock parts) to the game, all can communicate with each other via a processor unit. The logic and behavior of the processor are fully customizable, enable the player to add automatic actions and reactions to the spacecraft or whatever you can make in Kerbal Space Program.

## What does KASM mean?

I don't know, it could be any of the following:

* KASM Ain't State Machine

* Kerbal Automated State Machine

* Kerbal Assembly
